      <p>It hadn’t yet been a day since I’d been home for winter break, and I already had grown bored of just sitting around. Sure, we all dream of the promised land after the semester is over, where there are no responsibilities and no homework, and where finals are nothing but a faint memory in our heads, but in reality, it gets old, fast.</p>

<p>Speaking of finals, though, there’s a peculiar phenonenom the seems to occur during the last week or so of the semester—college students, instead of studying, will inevitably spend all of their free time calculating the lowest possible grade they can get on their finals to still get the grade they want in their classes. I’m not immune to it myself—it’s fun, and quite frankly relieving, to discover you only need a 65% on your CS final to get an A in the course. And if you look online, you’ll find there’s plenty of websites that do the calculations for you. I decided to make one too.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>As a new programmer, I’m always trying to absorb as much information as possible and learn as many tools as possible. After reading through the <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/">daunting list</a> of “What every computer science major should know” by Matt Might, I came to the realization that I have a <em>lot</em> of work ahead of me.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>Ever since Apple declined to release new Retina Macbook Pros at WWDC 2016, I’ve been on the hunt for a laptop to tide me over until the eventual release sometime in the fall. While I don’t exactly <em>need</em> a new laptop just yet (after all, the lab computers at Penn State would be perfectly serviceable for the first few months of my first semester) I decided I would prefer to have something portable to take to class. I wasn’t planning on breaking the bank, so I settled on a Chromebook, and after researching a bit (with the help of <a href="http://reddit.com/r/chromeos">Reddit</a>) I settled on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Chromebook-CB35-C3300-Backlit-Keyboard/dp/B015806LMM">Toshiba Chromebook 2</a>, the 2015 edition with the backlit keyboard and 1920x1080 IPS screen. I was able to find a great deal on a refurbished one for $230.</p>
