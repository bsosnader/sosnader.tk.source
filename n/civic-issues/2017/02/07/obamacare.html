		<p>The Affordable Care Act, or as it’s better known, Obamacare, has been a sharply partisan issue since the moment it was conceived. One would think that on the topic of healthcare, both sides of the aisle could come together to find a solution good for the entirety of America, however, that has not been the case.</p>

<p>The history of Obamacare begins on the campaign trail. Obama promises a solution to rising healthcare costs, saying, “On health care reform, the American people are too often offered two extremes — government-run health care with higher taxes or letting the insurance companies operate without rules. … I believe both of these extremes are wrong.”</p>

<p>Obama, from the very start of his first term, was committed to making some form of healthcare reform happen. He began discussions, pushed Congress to start drafting up plans, and made it one of his priorities. It’s important to note that Obama took a different approach than Bill Clinton had before him. Bill Clinton had formed a plan of his own, and then presented it to Congress. Obama knew that he had to let Congress work out something that could actually get passed. Obama also made sure he had the support of some major players in the healthcare industry, something else that was needed. Most importantly, Obama tried, from the very beginning, to get Republican support for the bill.</p>

<p>However, that goal simply was not happening. In 2009, the healthcare bill passed through the House (where Democrats had a supermajority) with only a singular Republican vote. It would find a much more difficult time getting through the Senate. In the Senate, the so-called “Gang of Six” formed, contrived of three Democrats and three Republicans, who were supposed to build a bill that would be agreeable for all.</p>

<p>In fact, the basis of the plan discussed at this point was actually a Republican healthcare plan from the 90s. It was not a single-payer system, which would be a firmly Democratic and liberal system. It still involved the insurance companies and it still had an individual mandate. However, it was certainly a step in the right direction. Obama was trying to make real compromise here, along with the Democratic Congresspeople.</p>

<p>However, the negotiations were a sham. Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate Republicans, had already told his members that they could not reach a deal with the Democrats, and that none of them would be voting for any sort of healthcare reform bill. (Sidenote: I can’t be unbiased here. Mitch McConnell is a partisan hack. He represents everything that is wrong with the Republican party, and partisan politics as a whole. His obstructionism of the past eight years, and his, frankly, imbecilic manner of running the Senate, is pathetic. I can’t stand anything about the man.) The negotiations went on for a little while more, and then fell apart. Eventually, when brought to a vote, every single Democrat voted for, while every Republican voted against.</p>

<p>The rest is history. Obamacare went to the Supreme Court, and was upheld. Due to the controversy, Republicans were able to make sweeping gains in the House in 2010, which, coupled with the census, lead to the redistricting and gerrymandering I talked about last article. Republicans would spend the next eight years blocking anything and everything that even had a faint whiff of Obama on it.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/aca.png" alt="affordable care act" /></p>

<p>This is what partisanship does to America. An originally Republican plan gets decried by Republicans simply because Democrats were the ones pushing for it. Healthcare reform, something everyone needed at the time, was crippled by the partisanship of Congress. People hated Obamacare simply because of the name Obama. I remember watching a video clip of people being asked if they preferred the Affordable Care Act over Obamacare. Many said yes, having no idea they were the same thing.</p>

<p>Even now, partisanship blinds citizens from making rational decisions about the policies their government passes. There are thousands of Republican Trump supporters who are on Obamacare, who don’t want it to go away. If you look on Twitter, you can see them complaining to Trump about repealing it. They didn’t realize what they voted for, and now they regret it.</p>

<p>It would be funny, if it weren’t so sad.</p>
