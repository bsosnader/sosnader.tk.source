		<p>My experience at a deliberation was very positive. On Monday, I went to a deliberation on sexual assault in college in a place called “CommonPlace.” It was super cozy, with couches and futons galore. This was in stark contrast to our own deliberation, which was on the third floor of a church in a bleak and forboding space. Regardless, we sat down, and the deliberation began.</p>

<p>The audience was completely comprised of college students. I wasn’t exactly surpised by that, but I was kind of hoping to see more adults taking part. There was only one student <em>not</em> in an RCL class there, which also was not that surprising, but again, I was kind of hoping for a greater variety.</p>

<p>Sexual assalt is a delicate topic, and I was worried that this group might make a few slip ups in their explanaiton and introduction to the topic. However, I thought they did a pretty good job of explaining the issue and kicking off the discussion. Another thing I was worried about was that nobody would want to participate. That wasn’t the case as well. Everyone had a lot to say, and a lot to talk about.</p>

<p>The group did really well with their amount of questions, and finding good follow up questions to keep the conversation going. I think that’s one of the hardest parts of completing a successful deliberation, because when the discussion dies down, it gets <em>really</em> awkward.</p>

<p>The main approaches that we discussed involved three different things: approaching sexaul assault education at a younger level, providing more education and support at the university level, or increasing punishments and awareness of punishments. I think most people, myself included, thought the best approach would involve more education at a younger level. However, there’s definitely issues with implementing that, for instance, in areas (like the SOUTH) where this type of sexual education doesn’t fly.</p>

<p>The second approach involved better education in the university setting. We all agreed that the Penn State programs like SAFE/AWARE aren’t that effective because people who don’t care can just ignore them. Also, programs that other universities have aren’t that effective either because they’re ususally opt-in, and those who are most likely to opt in are the ones least likely to commit sexual assualt in the first place.</p>

<p>The final approach involved increasing punishments and increasing awareness of punishments in an attempt to deter would-be assualters. A really good point was brought up that I hadn’t thought of before– that increasing punishments might actually lead to <em>less</em> reporting by victims. Often, sexual assault attackers are known to the victim, and unfortunately, victims feel bad sometimes about “turning in” their attacker to face punishment.</p>

<p>One of the big things I thought was important to discuss was how to properly educate people on the concept of consent. If everyone had a very clear, very strong defintion of consent, I think it would help this issue greatly. There are a lot of shitty people out there who do things and don’t think they’re doing anything wrong. However, if we had a really clear concept of consent firmly ingrained in everyone’s mind that it would help shame people into not doing these sorts of things.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought it was a really good deliberation with a lot of productive discussion that led to me thinking about some things I hadn’t thought about before.</p>
