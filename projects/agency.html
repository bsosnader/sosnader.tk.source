<p>I designed this website for a local business owner who wanted to attract more customers to his business. He wanted to be able to have pictures in a gallery so I added a dynamic photogallery for him. He also wanted to be able to post articles on his own so I included a content management system in PHP so he could add pages on his own. The website is dynamic and looks great on both mobile and desktop browsers. <a href="http://sosnaderagency.com" target="_blank">View it live here</a></p>
