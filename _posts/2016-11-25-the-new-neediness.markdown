One aspect of the *The Circle* that I think Dave Eggers utilized really well to critique modern society was his depiction of the "neediness" that people seem to have developed, the desire for attention that overwhelms Mae at points, and disgusts Mercer. It's the relentless begging for likes, shares, pings, and responses that seems ridiculous, but has solid basis in reality. We see it many times throughout the book. Mae is pestered by people when she becomes famous to respond to all of their notes, to look at their websites, to help their children with this or that by giving them attention. Francis's strange desires, like asking Mae to rate his "performance" also reflect this neediness. It's mostly seen through the social and online aspect of the book. As Mercer says:

 >Now the movie stars beg people to follow their Zing feeds. They send pleading messages asking everyone to smile at them. And holy fuck, the mailing lists! Everyone’s a junk mailer. You know how I spend an hour every day? Thinking of ways to unsubscribe to mailing lists without hurting anyone’s feelings.

 This attitude is already becoming pervasive online. People will follow hundreds of others in the hopes of getting follow backs, they offer "like for like," comment to get ratings and messages from their friends on Facebook, send snapchats out to everyone and get offended when people open and don't respond to them. 

 It wasn't always like this, obviously. What changed? To me, it seems pretty simple. In the past, we didn't expect people to respond and interact so much and so rapidly because we simply couldn't. When you sent a letter you had to wait a while for a response, and even if you didn't get one, it was possible that your letter was just lost. After the invention of the telephone, communication became easier, but if someone didn't pick up the phone you simply had to assume they were busy. However, once smartphones and the Internet were invented, it became much harder for people to "excuse away" others behavior. You no longer could assume that someone just "didn't see the text" because you can go and look at their social media accounts and see that they're using their phone and just ignoring you. And although we rationally know there are many reasons why someone wouldn't get back to you instantly (and if you think about it, you've done it many times yourself, often by accident), we find it hard to reconcile that idea in our head. 

 Yet, as always, Eggers goes too far. Yes, in today's society, we all get a little miffed if we don't get a response, or a like, or if we see an opened snapchat. But we get over it, because we know that in the end, it's not a big deal. Even with the hypersociality of The Circle, it's unrealistic that people would become *that* needy, *that* whiny, and *that* intense. The causes are the same, but the effects in real life are nowhere near the effects in the book.
