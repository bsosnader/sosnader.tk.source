*Discworld* is not one book, but a series of books by the English author Terry Pratchett. It's one of my all time favorite series. Terry Pratchett is, unfortunately, deceased, but before he went, he wrote 40 of these books, so he did pretty well for himself. 

The idea behind the Discworld universe is that, you guessed it, the world is a disc. The disc rests atop four elephants, which are standing on a giant turtle which floats through space. Yeah. Very realistic. It's a fantasy world, with magic and all sorts of other crazy things. It's kind of disengenuous to call Discworld a series, though. It's more like a large collection of books all in the same universe, with different recurring people and areas and a (kind of loose) overall story. 

There's actually no need to read any of the stories in any particular order. I personally read them all in their published order, but that's not necessary. There's a few infographics online outlining good ways to start, and the different story arcs and plotlines. In general, there's four main groups of people to look out for. There's Rincewind, who's a magician, the Witches, who are witches (duh), Death (I don't have to explain), and The Watch. The Watch follows the lives of the city watchmen in Discworld's twin cities, Ankh Morpork.

The reason I like these books so much is not just because they're good fantasy books (and I really like fantasy), but because they're actually incredibly funny. If you've ever read *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,* you'll know exactly the type of humor I'm talking about. It's that dry British wit that comes out in fantastic ways. 

I'll leave you with some of the [best quotes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/donnad/discworld-quotes-about-life-the-universe-and-everything) from the books.
