Today I'm gonna talk about one of my favorite fantasy series by one of my favorite authors: *The Stormlight Archive,* by Brandon Sanderson. Brandon Sanderson has been around for a while, and he basically writes books like a tank. If you're sick of George RR Martin's incredibly slow writing pace, then you'll be glad to hear that Sanderson is the exact opposite. He just churns out book after book, series after series, and it's all quality.

I actually first read Sanderson books in gradeschool--he had this series for young adults about this evil cult of librarians. It was funny and well written. About a year ago, I read through a lot of his other works, and loved it all. He's mainly a fantasy writer, and all of his fantasy series have really cool, unique systems of magic and little quirks. He's really good at fleshing out cool, fantastical elements in his stories. Another cool thing is that many of his stories and series are actually connected under one big universe that he calls "The Cosmere." You can find hints and refernces to other stories and events in just about all of his books. 

Anyway, on to *The Stormlight Archive.* He has another really great series, *Mistborn,* which I also loved, but I'll save that for another time. *The Stormlight Archive,* is Sanderson's first attempt at writing an epic fantasy series (like along the lines of *Game of Thrones*, or *The Wheel of Time*, which Sanderson actaully finished after the original author died). These books are really long. He plans on publishing ten books, and there's two already out, with a third coming later this year. Unlike GRRM, I actually have faith that Sanderson will finish the series. 

Okay, so I can't really properly describe what the world in these books is actually *like,* because it's pretty complicated, but I'll send you over to [Wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_Kings#Setting) description of the setting. There's like magic gemstones and spirits and really cool glowing swords and stuff. 

One possible downside of Sanderson that he tends to write very clean books. If you're used to GRRM and lots of blood, sex, and cursing, you'll be disappointed to not find any of that in Sanderson's books. His characters don't curse, instead opting to say things like "Storms!" where you'd expect someone to say "Fuck." Romance is very PG and may remind you of middle school, rather than real life. But his books are always just really enjoyable to read. You get drawn in to the world, and the creative elements behind it. Sanderson is really good at worldbuilding and creating an intense and exciting story, even if his prose isn't my personal favorite style.
