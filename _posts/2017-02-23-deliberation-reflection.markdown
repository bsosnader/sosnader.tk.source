title: "Deliberation Reflection"

My experience at a deliberation was very positive. On Monday, I went to a deliberation on sexual assault in college in a place called "CommonPlace." It was super cozy, with couches and futons galore. This was in stark contrast to our own deliberation, which was on the third floor of a church in a bleak and forboding space. Regardless, we sat down, and the deliberation began.

The audience was completely comprised of college students. I wasn't exactly surpised by that, but I was kind of hoping to see more adults taking part. There was only one student *not* in an RCL class there, which also was not that surprising, but again, I was kind of hoping for a greater variety. 

Sexual assalt is a delicate topic, and I was worried that this group might make a few slip ups in their explanaiton and introduction to the topic. However, I thought they did a pretty good job of explaining the issue and kicking off the discussion. Another thing I was worried about was that nobody would want to participate. That wasn't the case as well. Everyone had a lot to say, and a lot to talk about. 

The group did really well with their amount of questions, and finding good follow up questions to keep the conversation going. I think that's one of the hardest parts of completing a successful deliberation, because when the discussion dies down, it gets *really* awkward. 

The main approaches that we discussed involved three different things: approaching sexaul assault education at a younger level, providing more education and support at the university level, or increasing punishments and awareness of punishments. I think most people, myself included, thought the best approach would involve more education at a younger level. However, there's definitely issues with implementing that, for instance, in areas (like the SOUTH) where this type of sexual education doesn't fly. 

The second approach involved better education in the university setting. We all agreed that the Penn State programs like SAFE/AWARE aren't that effective because people who don't care can just ignore them. Also, programs that other universities have aren't that effective either because they're ususally opt-in, and those who are most likely to opt in are the ones least likely to commit sexual assualt in the first place. 

The final approach involved increasing punishments and increasing awareness of punishments in an attempt to deter would-be assualters. A really good point was brought up that I hadn't thought of before-- that increasing punishments might actually lead to *less* reporting by victims. Often, sexual assault attackers are known to the victim, and unfortunately, victims feel bad sometimes about "turning in" their attacker to face punishment. 

One of the big things I thought was important to discuss was how to properly educate people on the concept of consent. If everyone had a very clear, very strong defintion of consent, I think it would help this issue greatly. There are a lot of shitty people out there who do things and don't think they're doing anything wrong. However, if we had a really clear concept of consent firmly ingrained in everyone's mind that it would help shame people into not doing these sorts of things.

Overall, I thought it was a really good deliberation with a lot of productive discussion that led to me thinking about some things I hadn't thought about before.
