title: "The Reversal of the Political Parties"
---

We all know the two main political parties of today. On the one side, there's the Republicans: staunch conservatives who favor small government, state's rights, and big business (yes, this is an oversimplification). On the other side, there's the Democrats: liberals who focus more on big government programming and social progressiveness. 

But it wasn't always like this. Before we get into the history of the Democratic and Republican Parties specifically, let's take a look at the history of political parties in the United States as a whole.

## George Washington

George Washington, our first president, wasn't actually in any political party, technically. He actually did not like the idea of political parties, saying in his Farewell Address: 

>"However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion."

(Perhaps even more pertient in our present political climate).

So anyway, that didn't last long.

## Federalist Party

Technically, the Federalist Party could be considered the party of Washington. Its ideas were centered around the concept of federalism, i.e. a strong central government. 

## Anti-Federalist Party

Self explanatory, basically. These guys sprung up right around 1800 and focused more on the common people and their right for representation. They were renamed the Republican Party, and then the Democratic-Republican Party. In the 1810s, the Federalist Party fell apart. The Democratic Republican Party split into different factions. Around the time of Andrew Jackson's presidency, they were renamed simply the Democratic Party. 

## Whig Party

A different faction of the Democratic Republican Party formed the Whig Party.  The Whig Party is important in the formation of the Republican Party because the Republican Party continued many of the ideas of the Whig Party, mainly, big government involvement.

## Democratic and Republican Parties

So, the timeline where we can begin discussing these two parties and how they changed starts right around the Civil War. The Republican Party at the time, was the "party of Lincoln," and as such, promoted forward-thinking ideas like freedom of slavery, voting rights for black men, and big government. The Democratic Party at the time was more traditional--it wasn't new and fresh like the Republican Party, and it focused more on things like state's rights. 

After the Civil War, the Republican Party had multiple factions--some with more progressive economic ideas, and some with more conservative ideas. This will be important later.

Right before 1900, with William Jennings Bryan being the Democratic Party's presidental candidate, the party shifted a bit more to the progressive side. WJB incorporated the Populist Party under the Democratic Party, which gave it a more economically left angle. 

Now, remember how the Republican Party had those two factions? In 1912 Teddy Roosevelt runs under the Progressive Party, not the Republican Party, breaking away that progressive faction and leaving only the conservative behind. Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s adopted Progressive Party platforms into the Democratic coalition. 

A major shift comes in the 1960s with Lyndon B Johnson. Civil Rights become part of the Democratic Platform, and alienates many southern white voters. At this time, the Republican Party begins implementing the "Southern strategy," where they appealed to southern, racist, white voters who were alienated by the Democratic Party. 

So, at this point, we can generally see the political parties having the same alignments as they do today. The Democratic Party embraced many progressive ideals, both economic and social. The Republican Party ended up losing its progressive economic wing and, to get more votes, became more socially conservative. However, the parties were still not super polarized at this point. You could find conservative democrats and liberal republicans. 

Contrast that with today's political climate, and you see extreme polarization on both sides. There's barely ever any compromise, and it's frankly vicious to watch. The reasons for this, in my opinion, are largely due to the polarization that occurred during the Obama presidency. I touched on that in my previous post. 

So that's the general gist of it. I think we're due for a reorganization of splitting of either or both of the two parties soon. The polarization is too extreme, and there's infighting in the parties. We'll see.
