For the past few weeks, I've been doing books that I think speak to everyone--books that I think everyone would enjoy reading and that apply to all of our lives. And although I enjoy reading those sorts of books, I'd be lying if I said they're the majority of books I read. In reality, I mostly read fantasy and sci-fi. And although you may not enjoy these books as well, I feel like it'd be wrong if I didn't give them fair representation. So in the coming weeks I'll probably be doing more of those. 

With that being said, *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* is a true classic, and something anyone can enjoy--as long as they like dry British humor. Written by Douglas Adams, this book is packed full of clever wit and exotic characters. It follows the life of the most boring and mundane British person ever, Arthur Dent, as he finds himself suddenly teleported out into space right before the destruction of Earth by his friend Ford Prefect, who's actually an alien. 

Don't worry, though, it gets a lot weirder. You'll be introduced to the perils of Vogon poetry, a man with two heads and a depressed android, and the importance of always having your towel. It's definitely not for everyone, but the humor is out of this world (see what I did there), including clever phrases such as this one, describing teleportation:

>“It's unpleasantly like being drunk." 

>"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?" 

>"You ask a glass of water.”

The whole book is like this, and it's a wild ride that I never find myself tired of reading. If you're into this genre, and somehow haven't read it yet, I highly recommend checking it out. There's four other books after it, all just as funny, and even a sixth written after he died by another author.
