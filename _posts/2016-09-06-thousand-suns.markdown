To kick off my first "real" passion post, I've decided I'll start with discussing one of my favorite books, *A Thousand Splendid Suns*, by Khaled Hosseini. I'm not going to reveal any spoilers about any of the books I write about just in case anyone decides they want to read one of them, but I will talk about what the books are about and my reactions to them, among other things. 

*A Thousand Splendid Suns* was assigned to me as a summer reading book coming into my senior year of high school, and, as I had felt for most of my other summer reading books in my lifetime, I did not have high hopes. I was expecting another boring book that I'd have to slog through in preparation for the first day of class. I love reading, but the type of books given for summer assignments aren't typically up my alley. *A Thousand Splendid Suns* blew me away.

The book follows two womens' lives, Mariam and Laila, in war-torn Afghanistan. Both womens' lives are filled with incredible hardships, and they're constantly struggling to find happiness. The writing is intense and gritty, and as I was reading I was almost afraid of turning to the next page for fear of what would happen. The book gives an unfortunately accurate view of what women faced (and still face) living in such a stricken area. It also raises moral and ethical questions stemming from some decisions that the main characters make. Overall, the book was a smooth read, with a direct, clear language that emphasized the bluntness of the existence portrayed in the novel. 

I would recommend that anyone who enjoys reading even just a little to read this book. It pulls you right in; I was invested in the characters almost immediately. *A Thousand Splendid Suns* doesn't disappoint.
