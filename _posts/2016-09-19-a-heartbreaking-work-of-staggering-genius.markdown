This is my favorite book. If you're looking for something to read, read this. You won't regret it. It's a visceral gut punch of a novel, a splash of cold water to the face that fills you with emotions—sadness, anger, joy—but often also with laughter. It's unlike almost any other book I've read and it's one of the few books that practically forced me to read it in one sitting (it's over 400 pages—not an easy task). I don't even know where to begin. The book overwhelmed me, tore me apart, and made me think differently about what literature can do. I don't really know why it affected me so much. Maybe it was because of what was happening in my life when I read it. Or maybe it's just that damn good.

I guess I should tell you what it's about.

&nbsp;

Written by Dave Eggers (yes, *that* Dave Eggers), *A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius* starts out with an account of both Eggers' parents' declines and eventual deaths from cancer. Eggers must raise his younger brother, Toph, on his own while navigating through the daunting landscape of his young adult (early 20s) life. They travel across the country, and Eggers' desire to explore his life and struggles with himself clash with his need to protect and raise Toph. You can feel the intensity of the emotions pouring through the pages—he writes furiously, sometimes speaking directly to the reader, sometimes blurring the line between reality and the imaginary to get his message across. It's a wonder of postmodern writing, a stream-of-consciousness directly from Eggers brain, showing you his pain, his fears, and his desires. It's a portrait of one human's existence which is so different than most of ours, yet incredibly relatable. It will make your heart flare and your eyes tear.

There's so much packed into this book. Please just read it.
