Now that we've all finished *The Circle*, it's time to offer my thoughts on it. I also kind of want to address the ending, which probably shocked most of us. 

There's really no point in me describing anything about the plot of the book or its themes, as we all have explored them exhaustivly in our blogs. So I'll just talk about my opinion.

I *sort of* liked it. I thought it had a lot of good ideas, and some actual valid critiques of our social media-driven culture. I think we all can agree that, sometimes, some poeple use social media too much, and place too much of their self-worth on how their online image is perceived. There are also very valid concerns about privacy, and what governments and companies are doing with what you share online. There are very real possibilities of abuse and of people getting harmed or supressed due to this type of surveillance and data collecting. 

However, Eggers just takes it too far. He could have made his message much more insididious, and the infiltration of The Circle into the society much more subtle and clever. Instead, he just repeatedly smashes his message into your face, and makes his society extra dumb and unrealistic and automatically accepting of everything that The Circle produces. It wouldn't work like that in the real world. We already have so many activist groups trying to spread awareness and to protect the rights of people online. I firmly believe that if a situation like The Circle were to play out, it would have to be done a lot more cleverly than the book describes.

Finally, the ending, while surprising, is one of the more realistic parts of the book. We've seen the entire time how easily brainwashed Mae is. She's not a very likeable character. She doens't have any of the characteristics of your typical novel hero. So of course she's not gonna save the world. She's trash.

I really don't like Mae.
