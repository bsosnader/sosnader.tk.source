This isn't fantasy, and it's not a romance novel, but what it *is...* is **very** good. *The Martian* by Andy Weir is a book (big shocker there). If you only heard about or saw the movie, well, this is the book it was based off of. The movie, by the way, is pretty awesome and cool, but the book is also awesome, and more detailed than the movie was. 

If you live under a rock and didn't hear about the movie, then I'll just tell you what the book is about. Basically, it's 2035 and humans have sent a team of scientists to Mars, where they live on this little settlement. When it's time to leave, there's a huge dust storm and one of them gets left behind. He then has to figure out a way to survive for a *very* long period of time on Mars without anyone to assist him. 

The book is thrilling and intense, and Weir does a good job of the very terrifying thought of being stranded on a different planet. The story is told through journal-like entries from the main character, along with action scenes from Earth. It's a really fun read, because the main character is so lighthearted and snarky about his situation. Another cool thing is that the science of the book (and the film) is relatively realistic. There are some glaring errors and things that are ignored, but for the most part, nothing in the book (or movie) will make you say, "No, that isn't possible." Especially because it's in the future, so, you can explain away a few things with that. 

If you've already seen the movie or read the book, and want to read more about the science, [click this](http://gizmodo.com/science-of-the-martian-the-good-the-bad-and-the-fasc-1734726471). If you haven't read the book, read it. Or watch the movie. Or don't do anything. It's your life.
