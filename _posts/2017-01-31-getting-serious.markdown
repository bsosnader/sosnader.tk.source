title: "Getting Serious"
---

There's always so many new things to learn in the field of computer science, and I often find myself excitedly jumping from one new language or framework or whatever else to the next, never actually sitting down and taking the time to learn or make anything serious.

That stops now.

I'm giving myself a challenge--call it a late New Year's resolution--that every single day, from now on, I will spend at least one hour a day working on learning something new outside of my coursework. I have a lot of things I want to do--learn R, Scala, C, Haskell, dabble in some machine learning algorithms, practice coding on hackerrank, and more. I'm going to try to keep a journal of my progress, updating it weekly, or maybe daily, with what I've learned or done. 

I doubt I'll be able to keep to my word, especially when I'm on vacation and the like, but it will be an interesting challenge.

Without further ado, I present my [daily coding journal]({{ site:baseurl }}/daily/).
