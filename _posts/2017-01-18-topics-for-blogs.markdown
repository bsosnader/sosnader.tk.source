title: "Topics for Civic Issues and Passion Blogs"

My passion blog will be the same: books! There's so many more books (obviously). I may also do some negative reviews. For the Civic Issues blog, I've decided I want to talk about party politics and some things that have changed and occurred to affect that over the years. It should be interesting, and I have a lot I could talk about.
