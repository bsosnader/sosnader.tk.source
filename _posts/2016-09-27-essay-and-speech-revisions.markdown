title: "Essay & Speech Revisions"

There are a few revisions I'm going to be making to my rhetorical artifact essay and speech.

For my speech, I'm keeping the structure and format the same, but to aid in my presentation, I'll be showing quotes overlaid over pictures to supplement my disucssion of the rhetorical devices used in the speech. I think that having quotes displayed will be better than me reading the quotes, and having topical photos beneath them will help draw attention and make them less boring. I also changed my introduction to be from a soldier's perspective to make it more relatable and exciting to start off.

For my essay, I'll do a few things. The general gist of the essay is that it's comparing two speeches, given by Eisenhower and Stalin. Originally, my thesis was just about how the speeches were similar with a few differences. I'm gonna expand it to more prominently point out how typically one does not associate Eisenhower and Stalin to be similar people, but rhetorically, they were on the same page. That will add depth to the essay and make it more of a compelling read. I'll also add in more evidence in the form of quotes, and analyze those pieces of evidence and how they contribute to the overall topic. 

Other than those few things, I should be good!
