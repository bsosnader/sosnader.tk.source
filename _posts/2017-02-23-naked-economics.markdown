Today we're gonna take a different track than the normal fiction books I've been writing about. Instead, I'm gonna talk about a book that I sincerely believe everyone should read for the purpose of their own education. It's called *Naked Economics*, by Charles Wheelan. 

At first glance, you might be horrified at the prospect of reading a book about Econ. Economics gets a bad rap as a terrible subject, but it can actually be very interesting, if approached right. It's also incredibly important (in my opinion) for everyone to have a basic grasp of economics, because, after all, money is what makes the world go round. We deal with and hear about economic issues every day of our live, yet many people just don't understand what's going on. And it's not entirely their fault--it's true that economics can be a dense and inaccessible topic. 

However, this book is not that. It's easy to read, enjoyable, and has great explanations on a variety of topics related to economics. It looks at all sorts of situations around the world and explains the economics behind them. My eyes were opened to a lot of new perspectives and things I hadn't even thought about. While this won't make you an expert, it will definitely help explain a bit of what goes on in the world around you, at least economically. 

Like I said, I really do think everyone should read this book. In an ideal world, everyone would be able to take several in-depth economics classes to get a better, fuller understanding of the topic, but this book is a good start. Definitely think about checking it out if you're in the mood for a nonfiction book and for some self edification. Also, if you really want, you can read his follow up book: *Naked Statistics.*
