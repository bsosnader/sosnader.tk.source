---
* Intro Paragraph
	- War evokes strong nationalistic emotions
	- At height of WWII, ideals and commonplaces of western world being threatened
	- June 6, 1944 was day of essential Allied attack
	- would either be a turning point or represent failure of Allied counterattack
	- Dwight D Eisenhower delivered speech to Allied forces to motivate them
	- Eisenhower uses commonplace, pathos, and kairos to construct an energizing speech for his troops to march to victory
* 1st body paragraph
	- The speech uses commonplaces about freedom and democracy
	- Contrasts the Germans and the Allies
	- Not just American commonplaces, more universal 
	- [will analyze quotes from speech here]
	- Commonplaces remind soldiers what they’re fighting for
	- Commonplaces that soldiers relate to effectively prepare them to fight with passion
* 2nd body paragraph
	- Eisenhower uses pathos for motivation
	- Discusses “tyranny” of Nazis and their atrocities
	- Supposed to evoke anger against germans and pity for victims
	- Helps elevate drive to push forward and succeed
	- Appeal to emotion is needed to ensure soldiers are passionate about their fight
* 3rd body paragraph
	- Strongest motivating force in speech is kairos
	- Uses recent allied victories to show that Germany is no longer dominating
	- If the speech was earlier in the war, things would look much more bleak and would be harder to motivate
	- If the US hadn’t started throwing their support from the mainland, also would’ve been more bleak
	- Multiple factors combined together create the right moment for an invasion and right time for speech to motivate
* Conclusion
	- Wartime creates opportune moments for great civic events
	- Eisenhower’s speech effectively uses commonplaces that are heightened by the war to motivate troops
	- Pathos against German atrocities is another effective motivator
	- Most importantly, the kairos of the situation gives Eisenhower’s speech credibility and strength
	- Three rhetorical elements combine to drive Allied forces to victory on D-Day
