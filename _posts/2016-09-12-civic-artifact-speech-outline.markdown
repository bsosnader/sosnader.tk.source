title: "Civic Artifact Speech Outline"
---
* Introduction
	- Indroduce D-Day, talk about the odds that the Allied soldiers faced
	- Talk about how important the invasion was, how everything hung in the balance
	- Soldiers would have been nervous
	- Need to somehow motivate them and excite them with one short speech
	- Introduce Eisenhower and his speech
	- He needs to find the perfect words
	
	Thesis:
	- Eisenhower uses commonplace, pathos, and kairos to construct an energizing speech for his troops to march to victory
* 1st point
	- The speech uses commonplaces about freedom and democracy
	- Contrasts the Germans and the Allies
	- Not just American commonplaces, more universal 
	- [will analyze quotes from speech here]
	- Commonplaces remind soldiers what they’re fighting for
	- Commonplaces that soldiers relate to effectively prepare them to fight with passion
* 2nd point
	- Eisenhower uses pathos for motivation
	- Discusses “tyranny” of Nazis and their atrocities
	- Supposed to evoke anger against germans and pity for victims
	- Helps elevate drive to push forward and succeed
	- Appeal to emotion is needed to ensure soldiers are passionate about their fight
* 3rd point
	- Strongest motivating force in speech is kairos
	- Uses recent allied victories to show that Germany is no longer dominating
	- If the speech was earlier in the war, things would look much more bleak and would be harder to motivate
	- If the US hadn’t started throwing their support from the mainland, also would’ve been more bleak
	- Multiple factors combined together create the right moment for an invasion and right time for speech to motivate
* Conclusion
	- Wartime creates opportune moments for great civic events
	- Eisenhower’s speech effectively uses commonplaces that are heightened by the war to motivate troops
	- Pathos against German atrocities is another effective motivator
	- Most importantly, the kairos of the situation gives Eisenhower’s speech credibility and strength
	- Three rhetorical elements combine to drive Allied forces to victory on D-Day
