For the record, I want to say that I *almost* did another fantasy book this week, but at the last moment decided on this book instead. 

*Kitchen Confidential* is written by the famouse chef (among other things) Anthony Bourdain. Anthony Bourdain is, to put it simply, really cool. Not only has he been a chef for years and capable of creating amazing food, he also has a really cool TV Show *Parts Unknown,* where he travels the world and tries food from all cultures, all while teaching the audience about life and history in that particular area. 

But anyway, the book. It's basically what got him famous. It's a tale of his life in the kitchen, and it exposes the underbelly of commercial kitchens that you may not have known about. It's a really cool look into an industry that is really far more complex and interesting than you might think. It's also a very witty book. There are some darker parts, as Bourdain has not always had an easy life. But above everything else, it's just incredibly engaging. If you read it, you'll learn why you should never go out to brunch, why you should never order fish on a Monday, and how the mafia got involved with his restuarant (they supplied his meat).

Overall, this book kinda shows how messed up the cooking industry is. He talks about long hours, ignored injuries, and the necessity of a mascochistic personality. Becoming a professional cook is not for the faint of heart, and he makes that clear. But what comes out most in the pages is his sheer passion for the craft. You can tell how much he loves food and making food. 

It's a really fun read, and it's not even fantasy this time!
