Before we continue, I need to warn you--this is a Dave Eggers book. If you're not a fan of Dave Eggers, don't even bother considering reading this book. You probably won't like it.

I don't really know what it is that I like so much about Eggers' writing (other than *The Circle*, which I *didn't* like), but, much like *A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,*  this book also taps into something deeply emotional inside me. 

The book follows the path of two friends who have decided to travel the world in one week. One of them has apparently came into a large sum of money, and wants to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Their plan is to hand out random wads of cash to people they think deserve it in every location they're in. It actually raises a lot of questions about charity in general. Is it right to give away money only to those you feel *deserve* it? To expect people to behave a certain way just in the hopes that you'll deem them worthy of your money? On the surface, it seems obvious that they're doing a good thing for people. But the way some of the recipients react to the money makes you question it. 

There's also an interesting plot device that makes its way halfway into the book. Eggers actually revised the book, adding 49 extra pages that actually pretty heavily influence what's going on. It's really unique, and another part of the reason why I like Eggers so much. 

Since the book is about traveling, I recommend reading it (if you ever bother) during some sort of travel. It really enhances the feelings and emotions you get while reading it. Anyway, from now on I'll try to avoid any more Dave Eggers and stick to books that people might actually enjoy reading.
