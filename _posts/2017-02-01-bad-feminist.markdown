Okay, since you all hate Dave Eggers so much, I figured I'd review a book that I'm currently reading and enjoying that I actually think you'd all like. It's called *Bad Feminist*, and it's by Roxane Gay. 

The book is basically a collection of essays written by Roxane, often about her own life experiences, which she uses to make broader points and discussions about society today. The meaning of the title of the book is something she explores in some of her essays, namely, that it is okay to not always be a "perfect feminist." She says that it should be okay for one to enjoy today's often degrading music, or shows like The Bachelor, while also fighting for women's rights. Tha'ts not really what she focuses on too much though, as the book is mostly a discussion of the feminist movement and female issues in society as a whole. 

It's really, really good. It's probably one of the most level-headed, even handed approaches to the subject. I mean, I'm probably a little biased, but I really do think it gives a good, in-depth look at issues women face without going into "all men are pigs" territory. There are a few times where she goes off on tangents that aren't really relavent (there's a whole chapter about Scrabble) and some of the books she references and talks about are kind of terrible, but whenever she starts to get into the meat of an issue you can tell she's passionate about, the fire of her emotions and words comes out on the page.  I've included a quote from her essay on privilege. The whole essay is really good, but this part is the best:

>You don’t necessarily have to do anything once you acknowledge your privilege. You don’t have to apologize for it. You need to understand the extent of your privilege, the consequences of your privilege, and remain aware that people who are different from you move through and experience the world in ways you might never know anything about. They might endure situations you can never know anything about. You could, however, use that privilege for the greater good—to try to level the playing field for everyone, to work for social justice, to bring attention to how those without certain privileges are disenfranchised. We’ve seen what the hoarding of privilege has done, and the results are shameful.

I haven't finished reading the book yet, but I'm interested to see what else Gay has to say. Her perspective is very relevant and important.
