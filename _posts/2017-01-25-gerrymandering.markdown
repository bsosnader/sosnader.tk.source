Gerrymandering. It's a political term heard in the media often, flung at both Democrats and Republicans alike. Typically connotated as negative, it's been picking up steam as the rhetoric against "corrupt politicians" has become increasingly more popular. However, before immediately deciding on its efficacy one way or another, it's important to understand what it is, and where it came from.

 The definition of gerrymandering is "to manipulate the boundaries of (an electoral constituency) so as to favor one party or class." Voting districts for state or federal congressional districts can be shaped in ways to include or exclude certain areas of the population. For instance, if a politician knows that one area of town supports him, but another does not, he would prefer it if his district only included the people who do support him, to better his chances of winning. This type of shaping can silence the voices of people who would vote against the party in charge of the districting by splitting them up and diluting their voting power.

 The origin of the funny little word itself is a portmanteau of "salamander" and "Gerry." The Gerry comes from the last name of a certain Elbridge Gerry, who, in 1812, did just what the definition says--reshaped his district to favor his party. The shape was said to look somewhat like a salamander, and the name stuck. 

 So, what has the history of gerrymandering looked like, and how does it affect the political parties of today?

 In the 19th and early 20th century, the majority of gerrymandered districts were due to racism. The aim of many district-drawers in deep southern states was to weaken the voting powers of African Americans as much as possible. Because African Americans typically tended to vote Democrat, not Republican, the districts in these mostly Republican states were drawn to prevent the minorities from having a say in their governance. That's not to say Democrats didn't do it as well. Gerrymandering has a long history with both political parties spanning back many decades. It's a tool that's been used by corrupt politicans on both sides of the aisle.

 However, after the Voting Rights Act of 1965, things started to change. Laws were drawn preventing disctrics from being drawn in a way to disenfranchise minority voters, and a few of the worst offending states were required to submit any new districts to the Department of Justice for review. Furthermore, some new districts were actually purposefully gerrymandered to create so-called "majority-minority" districts, where a district was drawn specifically to give a voice to a minority community in an area. This demonstrates how gerrymandering is not always for a nefarious purpose. If there is a town that has 70% of one community and 30% of another, and you have to split it into two districts, there are a few options you have. You could split it right down the middle, giving each district 35% of the majority and 15% of the minority. However, now the majority will have the loudest voice in both districts, completely shutting off the minority. If you instead draw a larger district encompassing just the 70%, and a smaller one just encompassing the 30%, you get one district which represents the majority, and one which represents the minority. It's still technically "unfair," but it allows minorities to not get shut out of representation--especially in the light of the decades of racism and discrimination preceding (and following) the Voting Rights Act. 

Yet, even these sorts of districts can cause problems. In recent years, many "safe" red states have gained increasing amounts of minority populations. When populations increase, districts must be redrawn to accomodate them. One might assume that the best way to do it fairly would be using the "majority-minority" districting from above. However, that can be disenfranchising as well. If you have three typically red districts, each which have gained a large amount of a minority, you might be at risk of losing all of them, if enough minorty support swings them. If you instead funnel all those minorities into one *new* district, you can give them one district, but keep your original three.

So, what's gerrymandering like today? In 2010, a wave of hardcore Republican "Tea Party" politicians were voted into office. The timing, along with the 2010 census, meant these people were in charge of drawing new districts. Unsurprisingly, they gerrymandered the hell out of them. For the past 7 years now, Republicans in the House of Representatives have enjoyed a majority in part due to their control of state legislature and governances which lead to favorable districts for the House. The Republican party, in the past several years, has been more effective at gaining support in state and local politics, which allows them to have the groudwork to get more Congressmen elected, using, among other things, gerrymandering. Is it unfair? Yes. Is it legal? Also yes. 

The current, one-sided use of gerrymandering by the Republican party is indicative of the growing divide between the two parties in Congress. It's also indicative of the Democrats failure to mobilize grassroots as effectively as the Republicans. The Democrats must change their tactics if they want to overcome the effect decimination of their support that the Republicans have set in motion. It's actually quite shocking to realize that even with the massive shifts in demographics that have occured in the past decades, mostly in favor of groups that vote Democrat, the majority of states are Republican-controlled, Republicans have a majority in the Senate and the House, and a Republican is in the Oval Office. It's a combination of Republican voter-supression tactics, gerrymandering, but also a Democratic failure to capitalize on the shifting political landscape. One thing is certain, however--gerrymandering breaks the democratic process.

Are there solutions? Once again, yes, but it will take a long time before we see change. Gerrymandering is used by both parties go keep their power, and those who got elected due to gerrymandering are hardly going to turn around and destroy the very thing that gave them their power. But what can be done? Some states use nonpartisan committees to draw boundaries instead of the politicans, but even these committees can be infiltrated with partisanship. There are also computer algorithms which can draw perfectly "fair" districts, which seem quite promising, when looking at the results.

The results are quite different than the original, snaking, convoluted districts. Problem solved, right? Not exactly. These kinds of districts forego some of the positive possibilities of gerrymandering--allowing minorities to get representation where they otherwise would not. It's likely that the best solution will involve a combination of computer algorithms and committees. For now, we'll just have to deal with this being considered "fair representation:"
