Although George R.R. Martin's *A Song of Ice and Fire* is technically a series, not a single book, I can't talk about one book without talking about them all. And believe me, every single one of these books is incredible.

I'm sure all of you have heard of (or watched) HBO's adaptation of this series. If you've watched the show, then you know how amazing the story is. If not, then you probably have a general idea of what it's like-- dragons, swordfights, and more. But the books (and the show) are so much more than that. George manages to weave so many intricate plots together without giving away any clear idea of what will happen in the end. Also, he has no qualms about killing off important characters, so there's none of that "plot armor" that so many main characters seem to have. Everyone is in danger, everyone has plans, and there's no clear idea of who will emerge on top. 

Furthermore, George creates a complex, realistic world (well, realistic enough for fantasy) which its characters populate and exist with their own different cultures and traditions. One of the most important parts of any good fantasy novel is the world it's in, and George's world is interesting, engaging, and plain cool. 

The books are all behemoths, requriring a lot of invested time to read. They draw you in, though, and keep you engaged. Even the lenghtly descriptions of feasts were somehow still enjoyable to read. However, if you haven't read or watched anything yet, fair warning-- George might die before finishing the last two (or maybe even three) books. Then it'd be up to the show to finish it off. However, the show and the book have differences, and have branched off a little bit. So we may never know exactly how George plans to end it. Still, it's more than worth it.
