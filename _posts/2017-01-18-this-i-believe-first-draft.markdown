When I was a kid, I liked to argue. A LOT. I debated endlessly with my parents, fiercely combating against what I saw to be completely arbitrary rules, regulations, and restrictions. I remember one time, when I wanted to stay up late on a school night. My dad countered my request, saying, “But you’ll be exhausted tomorrow morning!” I shook my head, and he acquiesced. I was triumphant! Yet, just as he had said, the next morning was hell. When gently asked if I was tired, I stoically refused to admit it. 

As I grew up, my stubbornness softened. I still kept my love of debate, but I no longer stuck to my guns as firmly as I had as a child. The turning point came one day, in high school English class, when I was arguing with my friend about some topic we had learned in class. He made a particularly good point, and I suddenly realized he was right. I agreed with him. I knew I had lost, yet, it was freeing to be able to change my mind, accept a new answer, and move on. I believe in this sort of discourse. Often, people simply repeat their own rhetoric, never actually looking at the facts or making an informed decision. This attitude emphasizes a “right versus wrong” mentality, instead of one of collaboration and learning.

 I believe in being able to accept a new viewpoint, because without that skill, I would never have been able to learn as much as I have, both inside and outside of a classroom. Being able to rationally and coherently debate differing views, and being willing to accept when one is wrong, is essential for progress. Too often people are caught up in how they feel and what they believe, instead of listening to the facts in front of them. I believe it is necessary to be able to step back, look at the big picture, and reforge one’s ideas and beliefs in the face of new information. Without that ability, we will be lost to increasing divisions and disagreements. Let’s not agree to disagree, let’s agree to debate.
