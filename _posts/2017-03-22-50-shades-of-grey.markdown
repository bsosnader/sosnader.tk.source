DISCLAIMER: I have not actually read this book, however it was requested that I review a romance novel, so here it is.

I'm sure we all have heard of *50 Shades of Grey,* by EL James. It's basically a part of mainstream pop culture by now. It's rocked the nation, sold over 125 million copies as of June 2015, and been translated into 52 languages. Two movies have been made out of it and its sequel, *50 Shades Darker* (wow, what a creative name). 

So what *is* it about this book that makes it so popular? Could it have deep, compelling prose that pulls out the intricacies of love and romance, like the classic, *The Scarlet Letter?* Could it be that it perhaps takes a daring approach at a difficult subject, and executes a careful yet masterful exploration of BDSM? Or, maybe it's that the people have been longing for a well written book with a strong female lead, and *50 Shades* perfectly picks up this mantle.

Spoiler: it's none of these things. It's garbage, an awfully written erotic novel based on a *Twilight* fanfiction that has managed to capture so much attention due to it's exploitation of one of humanity's most basic urges -- sex. The only reason this book has done so well is because it's managed to put a mainstream face on an erotica novel. I'm not even sure how it happened, though, because the book is so poorly written. Not only that, it also portrays not a healthy, loving relationship, but one of abuse, exploitation, and cruelty. The relationship portrayed in the book is not one that any person should seek out, and by making it sound like a thrillfest, EL James is doing harm to our society's perception of healthy sexual relationships. 

Please, please, don't read this book. And if you already have, I am so sorry. I'll leave you with a quote from the book that makes me burst out in laughter every time I read it because of how awful it is:
