Another week has gone by, and it's time to review another one of my favorite books: *The Last Lecture*, by Randy Pausch. *The Last Lecture* is a book of lessons and stories written by Dr. Pausch, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon Universrity, after he was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. It originally started out as a lecture, titled "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams." There had been a movement going around in academia where top professors would deliver a "last lecture," i.e. what they would say if it was their last chance to impart some message to the world. In Pausch's case, it really was one of his final chances, as he was not expected to live longer than a year. 

The lecture went over incredibly well, and many of his friends and colleagues and students were there to listen and cheer him on. Pausch decided to write a book further expanding the topic so that his kids would have something from which to learn his beliefs, thoughts, and experiences when they grew up. The book is separated into three major topics. First, Pausch goes over all of his childhood dreams, like being a Disney Imagineer, being in zero gravity, or being Captain Kirk. Then, he goes into actually acheiveing those dreams (he actually achieves more of them than you would think!). He then goes on to discuss what he feels is an incredibly important thing—enabling the dreams of others. Finally, he discusses lessons he's learned over his lifetime and has some direct messages to his kids for when they are old enough to read the book. 

I loved this book. The messages it contains are simple, but meaningful. The whole concept of a man writing a book for his kids to read after his death really touched me and added so much emotional impact to every sentence I read. I'd like to close off with one of my favorite quotes from the book:

>“It's not about how to achieve your dreams, it's about how to lead your life, ... If you lead your life the right way, the karma will take care of itself, the dreams will come to you.”
