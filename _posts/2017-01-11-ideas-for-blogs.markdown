title: Ideas for Passion Blog and Civic Issues Blog
---

For my passion blog, I'm planning on doing the same topic as before--books! I've still got a lot to share. For my civic issues blog, I'm thinking a good topic might be looking at new legislation that is proposed/passed under the new presidency, and what kind of impacts and effects it may have, and how it differs from previous legislation. Another topic could be about party politics and how it has changed over time. 

For the "This I Believe" project, I have two ideas. The first is bascially, "I believe in doing things I enjoy." Often we are pushed to do things because they will help us get a job, or look good on a resume, and so on. Yet, for me, that's not worth it. I do things because of what they mean to me. Another one would basically be "I believe in discourse." I firmly and strongy believe that everyone should be open to discussion and argument and be able to accept when they are wrong and accept new viewpoints. Being able to calmly discuss issues and bring up factual, well reasoned arguments are extremely important to me. 

And that's it!
