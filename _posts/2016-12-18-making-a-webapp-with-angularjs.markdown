title: "Making a Webapp with Angular"
---
It hadn't yet been a day since I'd been home for winter break, and I already had grown bored of just sitting around. Sure, we all dream of the promised land after the semester is over, where there are no responsibilities and no homework, and where finals are nothing but a faint memory in our heads, but in reality, it gets old, fast.

Speaking of finals, though, there's a peculiar phenonenom the seems to occur during the last week or so of the semester—college students, instead of studying, will inevitably spend all of their free time calculating the lowest possible grade they can get on their finals to still get the grade they want in their classes. I'm not immune to it myself—it's fun, and quite frankly relieving, to discover you only need a 65% on your CS final to get an A in the course. And if you look online, you'll find there's plenty of websites that do the calculations for you. I decided to make one too.

I wanted to cure my boredom and learn at the same time, so I decided to make it using something I haven't really had experience with before: [Angular](https://angular.io). Although this idea has been done plenty of times before, I thought it would be a nice way to experiment with Angular. You can find the finished project [here](http://sosnader.tk/grade-calc).

I faced a few challenges in getting this project up and running, but all in all it only took me the better part of a Sunday afternoon. The biggest challenge that I had to overcome was to actually figure out how Angular worked. I had really never touched any sort of Javascript framework before this point and I didn't really understand the concept. After going through some tutorials and example code on the Angular website, I felt ready enough to tackle the project. 

The Angular team makes it really easy to get a project up and running with the [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) tool. After running their setup, all I had to do was configure a few components, set up my form and calculations, and apply some styles. It's pretty barebones, but it got me to learn the basics of what Angular is all about, and I'm excited to be be able to use its tools in future projects.
