*The Road*, by Cormac McCarthy, was another one of those English books that I was assigned senior year that I wasn't too sure that I'd like. It was the last book of the year, assigned after the AP test, and I was kind of thinking to myself, "do I *really* have to read this?" I had been looking forward to doing absolutely nothing in my classes after the AP tests. Athough my English teacher was one of my favorite teachers of all time, I really wasn't liking his insistence on having a discussion on a book that I didn't even know that I'd like during the last week of school. But I read it, because I actually like reading. It was more than worth it. 

*The Road* is set in a post-apocalyptic America where basically nothing is recognizable. The entire landscape is grey and ashen. There is no life. The story revolves around a man and a boy, father and son. McCarthy's writing is sparse, like the landscape, but one thing is incredibly vibrant: the strength of the father's love for the boy. The father's main focus is protecting and caring for his son. The story begins with a flashback that cuts to the core of the theme of the book that unfolds in the next pages. It's an easy read, but the emotional impact of the story leaves a lasting effect on you. 

If you have a long reading list, though, I would recommend waiting to read this book for a while. If you decide to have kids, wait until after that. My English teacher said that he read the book several times in his life--a few times before he was a father, and a few after. He said that the impact that the book had on him quadrupled after he became a father, because of the way the parent-child relationship is portrayed in the book.

Or just read it now. It's a good book regardless.
