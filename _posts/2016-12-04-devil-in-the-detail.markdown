To be honest, before we started working on this project, I thought that the hardest part would definitely be filming things, or maybe writing out the script to form a coherent narrative. Yet, our group finished those parts really quickly, and pretty easily. We divided our work up, got it done, reviewed each others, then recorded the narration and filmed a few scenes with a camera from the media center. All in all, a solid one day of work. 

The real trouble is coming from all the editing. First, we had some camera audio issues we didn't know about that had to be fixed in post-production. Now, at least for me, iMovie is a bit of a pain to use. It glitches with my audio clips, cutting off pieces that I actually wanted, and randomly resizing the lengths when I add pictures or videos to a different track, for seemingly no reason. It doesn't let me place clips where I want, instead forcing me to adhere to its random placement. The controls for several features are not nearly as granular as I would like them to be (looking at you, Ken Burns effect), and the UI seems unintuitive and hamstrung. I will admit, it's definitely better than attempting to use something truly professional, like Adobe Premiere, but I didn't forsee how much time the editing would take, partly because I have to figure out how everything works, and partly because just getting everything together and perfectly lined up takes lots of time. Still, though, it seems to be working out pretty well, and I'm excited to see what our final product looks like. 

One issue we still might run into and have to deal with is the length of our docmentary. We have a lot of info for each section, and we might run over the 10 minutes with everything we want to say. If that's the case, we'll have to decide what we can cut from it. Other than that, we're doing pretty well.
