*Maze Runner*, by James Dashner, is one of those ~classic~ young adult, dystopian science fiction novels that have been all the rage for the past decade. You may have heard about the movie that was made from it. The movie was trash. But the book wasn't bad. I really enjoyed it, and even reread it a few times. I think that even if a writer follows a stereotypical genre, or doesn't use much complexity in their writing, a book can still be just fun to read. This book was fun to read because of the concept behind it. 

In the book, children are stuck in a massive underground labrynth. There's a lot of mystery behind the whole purpose behind any of it. They have to try to figure out a way out, while avoiding the Maze's many dangers. The mystery of the Maze, and the motivations behind it, make up a large part of the book. It's a really interesting concept. Much like everyone liked The Hunger Games because of its unique concept, the same applies here. I wouldn't go into this book expecting much, but it's a fun and quick read if you're looking for a dystopian future sci fi fix. 

I have to warn you though, do *not* try reading any of the other sequels to this book. You *can*, if you really want to, but they just got extremely weird and really bad. Some crazy stuff goes down, and I just was not enjoying it. James Dashner is a good writer, but I think he overtaxed himself here. Still, though, the first book is good, and also is another book which is better than its movie. I don't think I've seen any movies that were better than their books. If you have I'd love to hear about them. That's all for this week!
