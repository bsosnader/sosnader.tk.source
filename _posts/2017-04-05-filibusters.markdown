If you've been reading the news recently, you'd know that the Democrats in the Senate have been planning on "filibustering" the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. And, if you were paying attention a few months ago, you'd know that the Republicans did the same to Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland. But what exactly is a filibuster, and what's its history? 

You may have a vision in your head of a lone Congressman passionately standing on the floor, speaking for as long as he humanly can to delay or stop the passage of an unjust bill. In fact, Senator Jeff Merkley, (D - Oregon) just acted out that exact scene last night, [speaking for 15 hours](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/senator-jeff-merkley-protest-gorsuch-nomination.html) against Gorsuch's nomination. But that wasn't even a filibuster. So what is?

The history of the word "filibuster" comes from the word "flee-booters" or "freebooters." Freebooters referred to pirates which would raid Spanish colonies in the Caribbean in the 17th century. Later, in the 1850s, the word morphed into "filibusters," and was used to refer to Americans who incited revolutions in Central America. It was only until 1890 that the term was actually used to refer to what we see it as today. However, the concept of filibustering existed in Congress long before that.

When the U.S. Senate was first created, it adopted rules which allowed for senators to end debate on a discussion and move right to a vote. These rules meant that a filibuster would be impossible--senators could simply move to move to a vote. But the rule wasn't used very often, and in 1806, it was removed. The first time the concept of a filibuster was brought up happened in 1837, although it wasn't called a filibuster. The Senate was debating on the passage of a bill to create the Second Bank of America, and Henry Clay wanted the debate to end immediately. Senator William King threated to delay the debate indefinitely, and Clay acquiesed. He didn't actually have to filibuster, but the door had been opened.

Filibusters still were used sparsely, however, the Senate enacted the rule of "cloture" in 1917, which was a rule that debate could be ended by a two thirds vote by Senators. This was later changed to three fifths, then back to two thirds. Filibusters began to pick up steam during the 1950s and 60s, when they were used by Southern Senators to delay passage of civil rights legislature. It's kind of funny that we see filibusters today as perhaps noble and valiant efforts, when the first times they were used in earnest were to prohibit civil rights. 

Up until this point, all filibusters had been "talking filibusters." Basically, senators would actually have to stand on the floor and talk for as long as the filibuster went. The record was over 24 hours, and while a filibuster was occurring, nothing else could be done or discussed. The rules were changed so that a topic or bill could be "virtually filibustered," while the Senate moved on to other things. This way, the Senate did not get gridlocked, but filibusters could still remain a thing.

Up until this point, filibusters could only be overturned by a two thirds majority vote for cloture. In practice, this made it difficult to stop a filibuster if one party was against it and one party was for it. However, in 2005, a new option was formed when Democrats filibustered some of George Bush's judicial nominees. Although cloture required a two thirds majority, there was a parlimentary rule which allowed any senator to challege any rule on the basis of constitutionality. The vote on whether or not to remove the rule would be decided by a simple majority. In this manner, it would be possible to challenge the cloture rule, declare it unconstitutional, and remove it, all with only a simple majority of votes. It was called the "nuclear option."

Filibusters have become more and more common as partisanship has increased in Washington. As we can see, the amount of motions for cloture has increased substantially, and although not all cloture motions are for filibusters, it is clear that filibustering has a lot of its gravitas.

The nuclear option has been used before, by Democrats, but only for lower-court judgeship nominations. Filibusters are still viable for Supreme Court nominations and passing legislation. However, even that might change, as Republicans have said they will use the nuclear option on Gorsuch's nomination if Democrats refuse to stop their filibuster.

Overall, the filibuster went from being impossible, to being rarely used, to becoming an almost common part of Senate practice. I believe this change is due to the increasing lack of compromise in Congress. I've touched on this increasing divide in some of my older posts, and I think it's important to recognize. Republicans and Democrats are, more and more often, simply refusing to cooperate with each other. The increasing use (and possible removal) of the filibuster is just another sign of that. As I've sad before as well, something needs to change.
