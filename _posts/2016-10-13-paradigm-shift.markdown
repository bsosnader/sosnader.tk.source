title: "Paradigm Shift"
---
The paradigm shift that I think I would most likely choose for this assignment actually comes from another class I'm taking-- Astro 5. In astronomy, there was a drastic paradigm shift around the time of Galileo and Keplar from a geocentric model of the universe to a heliocentric model. Basically, the world changed from believing that the universe rotated around the Earth to believing that the Earth rotated around the Sun. This change actually had drastic effects not only for the scientific community but also philosophically and religiously. There was tons of controversy about this change and it affected many things in many different sciences and teachings. I think it would be a really interesting topic to delve deep into, because today, we all know how the Solar System works, but back then, the "heavens" were thought of far differently than we think of them now. So I'm not really gonna put up another choice unless you guys really think this is a bad one, because I'm pretty set on this idea.

My favorite TED talk is one by Glenn Greenwald entitled [Why Privacy Matters](https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters). It's a discussion of why, in this digital age, our privacy still should matter to us. I actually used quotes from it when I was writing my Schreyer admission essay on the topic, and I think it's especially pertinent to us given our reading of *The Circle.* It's definitely interesting to watch.
