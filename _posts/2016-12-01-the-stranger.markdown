*The Stranger* is one of those classic novels, written in 1942 by Albert Camus. I read it senior year for English class. It's widely considered an existentialist novel, although apparently (a quick Wikipedia search tells me) Camus rejected that label (instead calling it absurdist). Regardless, it's really interesting, and shows what one can do with a novel beyond the typical storytelling.

The novel follows the life of a French Algerian, Mersault, as he goes about his daily life. Mersault, however, is no ordinary character. The book starts with Mersault receiving word of his mother's death, yet, Mersault hardly seems to care. This theme of uncaringness seems to follow through the entire book. Mersault only cares about the physical realities of the world around him, thinking nothing of the people, or emotions he should feel as events happen to him. 

Camus uses this book as a vehicle for displaying his philosophy of the absurd, and he does it quite effectively. In essence, Camus is contrasting the struggle of humanity attempting to find meaning in life, yet failing to find it. Mersualt is attacked by many people throughout the book for his seemingly uncaring attitude. People simply cannot understand how he does not see the same meaning in life as they do. In this way, Mersault is an existentialist.  

At first glance, this book may seem like another one of those stuffy books that English teachers tout around yet turn out to be awful to read (I'm looking at you, *Scarlet Letter*). But for some reason, this one stuck with me. The writing is beautiful to read. The novel takes an interesting angle, with one of the most unique main characters of any book I've read. And, like any good book should, it makes you think. It makes you ask questions. And that makes it worth it to read.
