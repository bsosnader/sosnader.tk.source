![The Circle and Penn State Seal]({{ baseurl }}/img/posts/seals.png)

What do Penn State and The Circle community have in common? Two wordsâ€”their size. One of the many things Mae is awed by as she enters the Circle campus is the vastness of it all, with rolling fields, courts, buildings, art, and so much more. Like many other new Penn Staters, one of the most striking things about Penn State is the sheer size of the campus. One can explore for an entire day and still not have visited every building or hotspot on campus. There's always something to discover. Mae is dazzled by the interworkings of The Circle and the countless different areas and rooms she is whisked around to. 

More importantly than the size, however, is the people. Penn State is often described as a "cult," and, if you come around on gameday, it's easy to see why it's described that way. Everyone is so connected to Penn State, and there's really not much else for miles around other than the university. Although Mae and most other Circlers commute to the campus, it's very clear that The Circle community is just as self-contained as Penn State. The workers spend much of their time there, either working, attending events, or making use of the copious facilities. Right when Mae starts working there, she attends a big celebration, already being welcomed into the community and folded into the seething mass of people. It is just expected that all the workers will want to make use of everything The Circle offers, much like many people simply expect that every Penn State student will get excited for football games and the like. 

One important way that Penn State and The Circle differ, however, is through The Circle's first mantra, introduced by Eamon Bailey: "All that happens must be known." The moment when SeeChange is introduced and the intentions of The Circle are made more clear is the moment for me, where I felt Penn State and The Circle started to differ the most. The difference started becoming clear when it was introduced what The Circle actually did: consolidate every single thing about someone online into one, TrueYou profile. Then, when the new cameras were introduced and all the uses for them shown, it became very clear that The Circle represented something very, very different than anything we have here at Penn State. Privacy is respected here. There's nothing even close to the "all that happens must be known" mantra. Sure, we have to carry IDs but that's mostly to ensure that we actually go here and to allow us to get access to the dining hall and other facilities. To show the difference, we can look at the Schreyer Honors College's mission statement and contrast it with The Circle's:

>* Achieving academic excellence with integrity
* Building a global perspective, and
* Creating opportunities for leadership and civic engagement

Clearly, the mission of Schreyer, and of the greater university is far different than the mission (so far) that we have seen from The Circle. For now, a shallow comparison of the two entities reveals several similarities. However, I suspect that as time goes on and the overall goal of The Circle becomes more clear, we will see a sharper divide between the two.
