title: Rhetoric Wins Wars

In rhetoric, *kairos*, the Greek concept of the "opportune moment," plays an important role in defining what makes a rhetorical or civic moment "great." One such example of an incredibly great civic and rhetorical moment was Dwight D. Eisenhower's famous speech to his troops on June 6 , 1944â€”D-Day.  Eisenhower, the then Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, delivers a brief, 243 word  speech to the men about to storm the beaches. The content of the speech is passionate, first starting by stating the cause the soldiers are fighting for. He says the men are bringing about the, "destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world." His words here and later in the speech are examples of *pathos,*  appealing to the emotions of the soldiers to get them riled up for fighting the Germans.

The real meat of the speech, however, comes a little later, and it strikes at the core of the power of kairos. Eisenhower changes tune, saying, "But this is the year 1944," meaning to emphasize the time that has passed since the crushing victories of the German blitzkriegs between 1939-1941. He goes on to list the victories the Allies have had over the Germans in the recent years. He discusses the Allies' dismantling of the German's air and ground forces. He poignantly sums it up by saying, "The tide has turned."

The timing of this speech within the context of the invasion that was about to take place, as well as what had occurred in the years leading up to D-Day, all combine to create the perfect storm which allows Eisenhower to beautifully motivate and excite his soldiers. The concept of kairos comes into place here so perfectly. Although the Allies had been having more successful operations, D-Day was an essential invasion which needed to succeed to allow the Allies to continue pushing the Germans back. Eisenhower uses these past victories to push his men to believe that yes, they can win the battle, they can continue their previous successes, and yes, they can finally strike a truly destructive blow into Nazi Germany.
