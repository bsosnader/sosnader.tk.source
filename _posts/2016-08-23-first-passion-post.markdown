title: My First Passion Post
category: passion

Welcome to my passion blog! Here I will have posts about a particular passion of my choosing. Currently I have narrowed the selection down to two different passions. My first choice is reading—I've been a voracious reader for as long as I can remember, and I always love talking about books I've read or plan to read. For each blog post, I would choose a book I've read and talk about what I liked or didn't like about it. My other choice is skiing—similar to reading, I've been a skier since early childhood. For a skiing blog, I would talk about techniques for learning, doing tricks, the best mountains and trails to go on, and my past experiences as a skier. Currently I'm leaning toward choosing reading, as I think that option would be more relatable and enjoyable, not to mention a little easier to write about. That's all for now, check back later for more posts!
