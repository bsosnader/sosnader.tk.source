*The Giver*, by Lois Lowry is a book that many of us probably had to read for school at some point in our lives. I actually didn't, and only recently read it. It's more of a book for people a little bit younger than me, but I still found it enjoyable, and the ideas it explored made me think. We actually discussed it (well, the movie) in our AP Psychology class that year, and after I read The Circle, and especially after I responded to this week's prompt about *The Circle*, I thought of it.

The book takes place in a futuristic society where all pain, fear, war, and hatred is eliminated. Everyone and everything is bascially the same. The people are uniform and conform to what the leaders ask for. The plot revolves around a boy, Jonas, who is chosen to be the society's next "giver." The concept of the giver is very intriguing, and what Jonas struggles with is the main theme of the story. Like I have with all the previous books, I won't give much away, but if you haven't already read it, it's worth the read.

But I'd really like to talk about the society that's set up in *The Giver.* The conformity of the people clearly leads to less pain and hate, but is it worth it? That question is emphasized in the book, and I think it's important to consider. In *The Circle*, too, the goal is to eliminate things like crime, corruption, and hatred by exposing everyone to everything and controlling it all. Is it worth the loss of rights, the lost of individuality, and the loss of freedom? Eggers clearly thinks not, but what do you think? Really consider it. I mean, a world without crime is unimaginable. A goal that would be amazing to reach. But what are we willing to give up to get it?
