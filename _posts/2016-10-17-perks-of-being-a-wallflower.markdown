I'm sure you guys have heard of *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*, either from the popular movie or from the book it was based off of. I remember seeing trailers for the movie but never really looking into it, thinking it wasn't my kind of movie. I had no idea it was originally a book until a friend of mine insisted that I read it. Apparently I was "four years too late" (the book's about a freshman in high school) but I figured I could still enjoy it. He told me "if you can, read it in one sitting." So I did. I read it over the weekend, without any expectations or understanding of what it was about going in.

It was not what I was expecting at all, but it was amazing. If you don't know, the story follows a boy, Charlie, as he enters high school and completes his freshman year. Charlie is not okay. He has faced many unfortunate circumstances, is a bit socially awkward, and can't really seem to figure out his place in the world. Charlie's freshman year is full of twists and turns, and ups and downs, and through it all, we always see Charlie being as genuine and kind as always. He's incredibly selfless, but has trouble taking care of himself. The book is intense, touching on very rough topics. It's very interesting to see the way these topics are viewed through the lense of a teenage boy. 

There's so much packed into the book for its length, and to be honest, it made me tear up multiple times. There are some passages that sort of bite right into your core, unveiling things you maybe didn't really want to think about before. If you get the chance, read it, and read it in one sitting. It's worth it.
